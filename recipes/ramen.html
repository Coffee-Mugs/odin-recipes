        The origin of ramen is traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. The word "ramen" is a Japanese 
        borrowing of the Chinese word 拉麵 (lāmiàn), meaning 'pulled noodles'. The dish evolved from southern Chinese noodle 
        dishes, reflecting the demographics of Chinese settlers in Yokohama. Ramen gained popularity in Japan, especially during 
        food shortages following World War II. In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the 
        dish. Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings.

        The last few 
        decades have seen a proliferation of regional ramen variations in Japan, known as gotouchi ramen. Notable examples include 
        Sapporo's rich miso ramen, Hakodate's salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata's thick, flat noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, 
        Tokyo-style ramen with soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama's Ie-kei ramen with soy flavored pork broth, Wakayama's soy 
        sauce and pork bone broth, and Hakata's milky, pork-bone tonkotsu broth. Ramen is offered in various establishments and 
        locations, with the best quality usually found in specialist ramen-ya restaurants. Ramen's popularity extends beyond Japan, 
        as it is known as rìshì lāmiàn in China, ramyeon in Korea, and has even made its way into Western restaurant chains. I
        nstant ramen was exported from Japan in 1971 and has since gained international recognition.

            <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Once hot, add oil, garlic, ginger, & onion. Saute, stirring occasinoally for 5-8 min or until the onion is 
                slightly seared</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of vegetable broth to deglaze the bottom of the pot. Use a wooden spoon to un-stick any bits that are
                 stuck to enhance the flavor of the broth</li>
            <li>Add remaining 5 cups of vegetable broth, tamari or soy sauce, & dehydrated mushrooms - stir</li>
