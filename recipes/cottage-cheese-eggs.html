        Looking to get more protein in your breakfast without protein bars or shakes? Try these High-Protein Scrambled Eggs with 
        Cottage Cheese. The eggs come out fluffy and delicious, and it only takes about five minutes to make. Like yogurt, I 
        always have cottage cheese in my fridge since it’s such an easy source of protein. Sometimes I add it to my frittatas or 
        waffles or make it the base of a breakfast bowl . Whisking cottage cheese into my scrambled eggs is almost too simple but 
        definitely worth sharing. This is a great recipe for people who don’t like the taste of cottage cheese, but want to 
        incorporate it into your meals because you can’t taste it.

    <h3>Making Cottage Cheese Eggs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If veggies that should be sauteed are being added, saute them first.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, cottage cheese, kosher salt and black pepper, to taste with a fork.</li>
        <li>If not adding veggies, heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and spray with oil. When warm, 
            pour the eggs in.</li>
        <li>Slowly scrape sections of eggs to the center of the pan as the bottom starts to set, creating soft 
            folds for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes total until just set.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and serve.</li>
    </ol>
