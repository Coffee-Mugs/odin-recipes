        <h3>My Black Bean Chili</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first time I made this black bean chili recipe, I found myself standing at the stove, eating spoonful after spoonful 
        straight from the pot. In all honesty, I think it’s the best chili I’ve ever tasted. It’s thick, creamy, tangy, and complex, 
        with depth from green chiles, fire-roasted tomatoes, and a healthy amount of chili powder. This is a family favorite because
         our dog, Ms. Beans, is notorius for blocking the entire entry way to kitchen when we make this recipe. If I'm being honest
         we don't even remember or know where the name Ms. Beans came from, but it stuck.
