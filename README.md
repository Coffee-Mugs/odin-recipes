The Odin Project - Recipes Website

This project is going to reinforce the introductory skills TOP has covered so far. 
These are the basic files for setting up a website & some brutalist web design.
I ended up re-inforcing how to create links, additional pages, & size pictures. Also learned exactly how slow loading 20+Mb pictures can be on a phone for websites :)
